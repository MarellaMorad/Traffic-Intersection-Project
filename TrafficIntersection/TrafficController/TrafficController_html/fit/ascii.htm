WARNING:Cpld - Unable to retrieve the path to the iSE Project Repository. Will

INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'clock' based upon the LOC
   constraint 'P1'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly in
   your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG
   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be
